# BeautifulSoup Learning Notebook  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I explored **BeautifulSoup** for web scraping. 

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside?  
- Extracting data from web pages using **BeautifulSoup**  
- Selecting elements with **CSS selectors**  
- Parsing tables, images, and links  
- Handling dynamic content with **requests**  

## ðŸŽ‰ My Experience  
It was **fun and great** to learn **web scraping**! I enjoyed exploring how to extract data from websites using BeautifulSoup. ðŸš€  

## ðŸ“¢ Credits  
Special thanks to [Keith Galli](https://github.com/KeithGalli for his tutorials on **web scraping**.  

## ðŸš€ Future Plans  
In the future, I can **add more projects** to this repository to explore advanced web scraping techniques and real-world applications.
